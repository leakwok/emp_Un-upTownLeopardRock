TLK + TRT:
    - read about currentTimeMillis() in documentation
    - created BEEG plan on KtS
    - reviewed QAF for relevant traffic

2021-12-17 12:16AM
TLK + TRT:
    - transcribed plan into plan.txt
    - wrote DISCO and QCC in notes.txt
    - created deliverable files
    - registered team in goog form
   
2021-12-17 1:17PM
TLK + TRT:
    - gave feedback to other teams
    - resolved issues about parameters for linSearch and binSearch, best and worst cases, and how many times each Array should be tested

2021-12-20 1:12PM
TLK + TRT
    - worked on plan (updated sizes, clarified "worst" cases for BinSearch and LinSearch)
    - added disco about the time it takes for variations of the LinSearch and BinSearch algorithm + disco about magnitudes of sizes of test cases
    - added qcc about replicability
    - worked on SearchDriver.java (translating our plan)

2021-12-20 10:03PM
TLK + TRT
    - resolved issue brought up by other Thinkeren about in which method we were finding the difference in time
    - updated LinSearch.java and BinSearch.java with library code 
    - updated plan with new test implementations
    - finished SearchDriver.java with test cases
    - filled out README.md
    - update notes.txt
    
2021-12-21 1:19 PM
TRT + TLK in spirit
    - presented to other teams about our experiment
    - discussed with other teams, specifically Puntu, LYJ, Incredibly Cohesive, and PSerbCo about their experiments
    - realized differences in running program on different machines

2021-12-21 11:41 PM
TLK + TRT
    - updated SearchDriver.java with moot code at beginnning, more iterations of smaller test cases, and print statements
    - updated notes.txt with observations about powers of 2 / log base 2 + BinSearch, GALLERY TOUR
    - updated README.md "Test Performed," "Results," and "Conclusions" with SearchDriver.java modifications and subsequent different results
    - monitored relevant Piazza traffic
